PyGenC is a Test Drivin Development (TDD) script to reverse engineer C code from google unit tests. PyGenC is also intented to enforce C standard and rules to optimize repository

To run script make a TestDef File with all the tests defined and run script using python PyGenC.py

Currently only works with cmake and linux. Will be expanding to multiple platforms and languages
